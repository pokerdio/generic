    “In order for stereo vision to work, the brain has to know
    something about how far apart the eyes are,” he said. Factors like
    prenatal nutrition can influence bone growth, which can set the
    eyes varying distances apart. “The brain can't possibly know that
    in advance of being born,” he said, and so, in those first moments
    of new sight—even with two good eyes—the incoming light will be
    mishandled by an unprepared brain.

*** chomsky interview - <2022-12-23 Fri> frontline stalemate 
    https://truthout.org/articles/chomsky-advanced-u-s-weaponry-in-ukraine-is-sustaining-battlefield-stalemate/

    I claim no military expertise. I do follow military analysts, and
    find most of them supremely confident, with opposing conclusions —
    not for the first time. My suspicion is that General Milley,
    former chair of the joint chiefs, is probably right in concluding
    that neither side can win a decisive military victory and that the
    cost of continuing warfare is enormous for both sides, with many
    repercussions beyond.
    ...
    ...tales concocted in Western propaganda about Putin’s plans to
    conquer Europe, if not beyond, eliciting fears that coexist easily
    with gloating over the demonstration of Russia’s military
    incompetence and inability even to conquer towns a few miles from
    its borders
    ...
    Meanwhile the U.S. is gaining enormously in multiple ways:
    geopolitically by Putin’s self-destructive decision to drive
    Europe into Washington’s pocket by ignoring very real
    possibilities for avoiding criminal aggression, but also in other
    ways. It is not, of course, the U.S. population that is
    gaining. Rather, those in charge: fossil fuel industries,
    financial institutions that invest in them, military producers,
    the agribusiness semi-monopolies, and masters of the economy
    generally, who can scarcely control their euphoria over bulging
    profits (which are feeding inflation with markups) and great
    prospects for moving on to destroy human society on earth more
    expeditiously.
    ...
    As we have discussed before, U.S.-U.K. strategists expected
    that Putin would occupy Kyev in a few days, as Russia did as well,
    it seems. There were plans reported to set up a Ukrainian
    government-in-exile. Both sides seriously underestimated Ukrainian
    will and capacity to resist the aggression, and radically
    overestimated Russian military power. U.S.-U.K. military analysts
    also expressed their surprise that Russia was not launching their
    kind of war, with immediate resort to the “hideous types of
    military operations” you mention. It was not hard to predict, as
    we did over the months, that sooner or later Russia would resort
    to U.S.-U.K.-Israeli tactics: Quickly destroy everything that
    sustains a viable society. So they are now doing, arousing
    justified horror among decent people — joined by those who
    implement or justify these tactics with the “right agency”:
    us. The strategic incentive is clear enough, especially after
    Russia’s battlefield setbacks: Destroy the economy and the will to
    resist. All familiar to us.

    https://sci-hub.se/https://www.jstor.org/stable/23932367
**** 1. what is up with empiricism?! what is up with abstract entities?
     - language frameworks (thing language; number language)

     - internal questions (whether entities exist as part of a language
     framework)

     - vs external questions (whether the framework/entities
     exist at all) <- here are the philosophical problems

     - the external question is a pseudo question - it hasn't a
     cognitive content - it isn't formulated in common scientific
     language - it is a practical question (whether to adopt a certain
     language) disguised as a theoretical question 

     - russel says propositions are mental events, but nah

     - adopting a linguistic framework is a matter of choice

     - terms of a framework may overlap with pre-existing common terms

     - what is rejected is the reality or the question of the reality
       of abstract entities in these frameworks;

     - derision for platonic realism, hypostatization (treating as
       names expressions that aren't names), "Fido" Fido principle

     - ryle says fido fido is a grotesque theory; carnap say maybe but
       grotesque or not it's not a theory, but the practical decision
       to accept a framework

     - must not regard acceptance as a theory, that is as affirmation

   - cut -d :   choose delimiter (also cut -d'|'  or  cut -d' ')
   - cut -f 1   choose which words are kept (only the second heree)

(buffer-string) - all the buffer, subject to narrowing, as a string


(char-after &optional pos) (char-before &optional pos)
(following-char) <=> (char-after (point))
(preceding-char)  ~~~
(bobp) (eop) => true if the point is at the start/end of narrowed window/buffer

      - thouhg Baker aligns his own interpretation of PI with
        Cora&Conant's, C&C only feature on Glock's list as
        interpreters of the tractatus
    - gives alternate taxonomy for PI interpretations
      - doctrinal: it sucks because:
        - fails to acknowledge modal terms in W's writing (?)
          - PI § 109: "we must do away with *all* explanation. and
            description *alone* must take its place; the problems are
            solved, *not* by giving new information, but by arranging
            what we have *always* known. philosophy *is* the battle
            against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of
            language"
          - PI § 126: "philosophy simply puts everything before us,
            and *neither* explains *nor* deduces *anything* - since
            *everything* lies open to view there is *nothing* to
            explain. For what is hidden, for example, is of *no*
            interest to us. ...  One might give the name 'philosophy'
            to what is possible /before/ *all new* discoveries and
            inventions"
          - PI § 128: "if one tried to advance /theses/ in philosophy,
            it *would never* be *possible* to debate them, because
            *everyone* would agree to them"
        - fails to take seriously W's metaphilosophical remarks 
        - claims that W advances doctrines (non-metaphysical ones)
          - use-theory of meaning
            - whereas W is at pains to warn against taking it as
              substantive and general claim about the phenomenon of
              meaning PI § 43 :" in a *large class of cases* - *though
              not for all*... the meaning of a name is *sometimes*
              explained by pointing at its bearer"
            - others who attribute to W/PI a use-theory of meaning
              - Habermas (1986, 115; 1995, 58 and 62-64)

              - Wilson (1998) talks about a use-theory of meaning
                while noting W does /not/ propound a use-theory of
                meaning
          - logical-behaviourist theory of the mind
          - refutation of the possibility of a private language
            (demonstrating its logical impossibility; and so refuting
            cartesianism)
        - discounts PI§§109, 126-133 or downplayed as purple prose
          out of W's excentricity
        - claim the Tractatus advances a metaphyscial thesis, the PI
          advances non-metaphysical theses that criticize the
          tractarian one 
        - it holds little sway now, but it was standard immediately
          after PI; common with employment of W in the social sciences
        - advocates: 
          - Saule Kripke
          - Normaln Malcolm
          - Peter Strawson 
      - elucidatory 
        - takes metaphilo remarks seriously
        - commits W to untenable positions (commitments which are
          implied by the doctrinal reading also)
          - tacitly presuppose that language is rule-governed and
            surveyable (somewhat Rylean?) - isn't this theory?! even
            if tacit
          - W becomes little more than a Rylean 
          - implies there exists some/thing/ "language" with a
            discernible form stable enough to survey and map,
            according to our conception of relatively stable
            grammatical rules
          - at best sceptical, at worst proscribe linguistic
            creativity and innovation: linguistic conservatism (!)
          - implies what John McDowell (1999, 44) called the ability
            to "view language from sideways on"
        - W seen as seeking to elucidate the grammar of our language,
          providing perspicuous representation and overview of that
          grammar, that is, the grammatical rules we follow
        - advocates
          - baker and hacker (1980, 1983)
          - glock (1989, 2004)
          - p.m.s. hacker (1986, 1996, 2001a, 2001b)
          - paul johnston (1989)
          - anthony kenny (1984)
          - dan hutto (2003) - delimited (less Rylean?) form
      - therapeutic (bff)
        - makes sense of w's text as a whole
        - doesn't commit W to bad 
        - different take on PI § 122 "perspicuous presentation is of
          fundamental importance for us"
          - elucidatory understands the persp.pr. as trying to point
            out how language actually is
          - whereas the therapeutical reader regards it as achieving
            the task of facilitating an aspect shift of our
            interlocutor - once they see things could be seen in the
            other way the grip of the initial picture dissolves - the
            philosophical therapist is a facilitator; not a legislator
            or policeman
        - expands on W's "captured by a picture" notion: therapy
          allows one to be freed from that picture by noting other
          pictures can be also valid
        - one should not see a philosophical problem as causing a
          mental disturbance, but /as/ a mental disturbance (W's claim
          that philosophical problems are problems of the will, not of
          the intellect) -> W saw p.problems as existential ones
        - the term bewilders analytic philosophers, who see any
          allusion to Freud as a grave mistake of W. W's relationship
          w/ Freud is complicated - often mentioned, sometimes
          disdainful of his claims, sometimes praising his brilliance.
          - mbe W was attracted to Freud by what was fundamentally
            wrong in his work (like w/ Weininger, mbe Frege, Goethe)
            "wrong but great"
          - mbe if you read closely W's not contradictory at all
            (disdainful of the scientistic justification of a
            metaphysics of mind w/ scientific credentials,
            appreciative of a therapeutic method). psychoterapy as a
            method, not psychoanalysis as a theory (see bouveresse
            1995, baker 2004 chap 9, 10)
        - motivation
          - what motivates elucidations /if not therapy?/
          - while elucidatory readers pay lip-service to the
            meta-philosophy of PI, by holding on to a goal that is
            /more than therapy/ they remain committed to a view of
            language no different than "use-theory" doctrinal readings
            (though they'd resist this accusation)
        - the resistance to the therapeutic reading of PI is founded
          on a desire to uncover hidden arguments in the PI and to see
          W as an analytic philosopher; this desire commits to some
          kind of doctrinal understanding of language (Baker came to
          see this in the late 1980s)
    - compares readings of PI § 1 
      - Hacker & Baker
        - consider the Augustinian view as the paradigm in which Frege
          (foundations of arithmetic), Russel (principia) and W
          (tractatus) were alleged to operate and PI § 1 as an assault
          on that 
        - the augustinian view:
          - words signify or name objects
          - sentences are combinations of words
          - that a word signifies an object consists in the intention
            with which it is used
          - the intention can be seen in behaviour, facial expression,
            tone...
        - the grocer anecdote in PI § 1 is taken to point out the
          different types of words to which "five", "red" and "apple"
          belong and that the difference in type rests on the
          differences in the operations carried in each case, and
          their ordering
          - this is unhappy because 
            - saying that each word belongs to a type implies that
              there is a "type of use" associated with a word, in
              abstraction from words being /put to a use/ particular
              to an occasion, context, by particular speakers 
              - how is this any better than saying words correspond to
                things? in fact we have done none better than to
                exchange "type of things" for "things"
              - i can readily imagine use cases in which "five" names
                a person (football) or "red" names a person (Hitch
                gives Red Adair as example, I'd choose a ginger
                person, or someone who's actually red in some way,
                such that the nickname transitioned from being used as
                an adjective)
              - the point isn't to replace our clumsy grammatical
                categories (noun, adjective, verb...) with better ones
                (based on types of use)
            - it leaves questions hanging
      - Hutchinson inspired by Mulhall
        - W's point is that words /might/ play many different sorts of
          roles, and it depends on what the speaker does with them on
          each occasion
        - "words do not belong to types of use" - ah, says me, isn't
          this also upsetting to W and theoretical? at least, can't it
          be misread like that?
        - it is the necessary /relational/ character of the
          Augustinian picture that is apt to lead us astray;
          Baker&Hacker replace it with another picture with the same
          type of necessary relationality, recast.
        - there is no such thing as a word outside some use; for a
          word /to be/ is for a word /to be used/ 
        - there's no language outside its use, and there's no "viewing
          from the sideways on" - we cannot stand outside language in
          order to talk about language - a thought W presses since
          tractatus without any recanting
        - to /get/ the last paragraph of PI § 1, the question to ask
          is "*Why is W's interlocutor not satisfied with the scenario?*"
          - mulhall argues that the question "But what is the meaning
            of the word 'five'?" invokes the word 'meaning' as coming
            from an inner mental process. The dissatisfaction with
            what has already been told takes for granted that nothing
            of the sort of the things we've been given (behavioral)
            can settle the issue even in principle; the question
            demands a transition to a wholly different realm of the
            inner
          - mulhall writes: "if the public, externalised versions of
            such procedures were not in themselves enough to establish
            the presence of understanding to the interlocutor's
            satisfaction, why should their inner counterparts?" (2001a, 45)
          - if wittgenstein's shopkeeper's way with words strikes us
            as surreal and oddly mechanical, to the point that we want
            to questionthe nature and even reality of his inner life,
            and yet his public behaviour amounts to an externalised
            replica of the way we imagine the inner life of all
            ordinary, comprehending language users, then our picture
            of the inner must be as surreal, as oddly mechanical as
            W's depiction of the outer (2001a, 46)

          - this thing, body with hands and stuff which sees, and
            interacts from a reference point
          - agent, a helmsman that operates, has intentions, can will,
            decides, determines
        - scientific evidence that humans are both (?! 5:30)
          - if you're going to be tickled your brain will be in a
            certain way, so you do treat differently what is to be
            done to you and what you do to you
          - skeptical of popular psychology language: how far can we
            go in explaining it all without any of that and by
            treating ourselves as stuff
    - all 3 are asked "are you looking at a self when you look at
      me?" "what are you looking at when you look at me?"
      - colin: i'd use the word (language, intentional &c. is useful
          etc.) BUT why expect our evolved prejudices to correspond
          to the physics of the world
      - mary: i'm looking at a PERSON; i'm not talking to your
        braincells; we need cells to do such and so, but cells don't
        do it; WE do it WITH them, we need them to do it...
        - colin: unnecessary to suppose anything more than cells;
          unnecessary to suppose something more than animals and
          things have, something magical
      - simon agrees with both again :D

    - what is metaphysics:
      - about being qua beings; about being in itself
      - about what the most fundamental questions
      - about what the categories of existence are
      - by examples: all that exist are material things; or events; or
        mind and spirit; or the world is indeterminate things happen
        not as a function of past states; there's multiple dimensions
      - the study of certain questions that have drifted from
        metaphysics and are now studied by science: what's tha nature
        of space/time/causation/physical laws
    - realist view of science: it answers metaphysical questions; it
      answers the deepest questions of reality
      - main argument: no miracles argument (a kind of intuition
        really) not just predictive element and encoding what we
        observe element, but that it can predict a phenomenon so far
        from current experience that when finally an engineering
        enterprise is built to tell the results are so mathematically
        precise and so anti-intuitive that it would be a miracle if
        science weren't revealing the underlying nature of things
        - science must be telling us that there is spacetime and it's curved
        - that light is waveish etc. 
    - scientific anti-realism: it's not globally skeptical; the view
      isn't that science is a socially constructed one game among many
      others; an AR may agree that science is progressive, that it
      tells us stuff worth knowing, but disagrees that it answers
      metaphysical questions
      - "yes everything could seem like theory is right and it still
        be wrong" - a bit like what if it's a dream? - "yea but.. who
        cares" 
      - argument from theory change: the history of science is full of
        changing our minds about all sort of formerly rock solid
        things; therefore though they predict/encode our experiences
        amazingly, and though they contain knowledge, we oughtn't
        believe the things science seems to say about the ultimate
        nature of reality; but without giving up the good stuff
        - optical ether (matherial stuff) -> maxwell's electromagnetic
          theory
        - einstein: brought the hammer on maxwell's EM theory; EM
          field is not stuff; 
        - quantum electric dynamic: is there a medium at
          all... weirdening
    - structural realism
      - science tells us about the structure but not the nature of the
        world
      - from henry poincare 
      - middle ground between realism and anti-realism
      - often when the metaphysical claims become obsolete, the
        mathematical equations survive just fine; newtonian mechanics

*** hacker vs searle vs searle debate on mereological fallacy & neuroscience
    https://www.pmshacker.co.uk/media
**** dennet:
     - has been making sameish points 40 years ago ("not 'my brain is
       in pain' but 'I am in pain')
     - interprets wittgenstein's quote ("only of human beings and what
       resembles human beings") as applying to brains - brains do
       resemble human beings [in some way... he's perfectly right to
       say so but the point is that you can only add "my brain
       thinks/hurts/votes" into the language game as a valid symbolism
       through completing the process of explaining the resemblance ]
     - there are personal and subpersonal levels of explanation [todo:
       pursue his work on stances] relating the two levels of
       explanation is not outside the philosopher's buisness grounds
     - distinguishes philosophy from anthropology - which he takes the
       study of concepts as used by the man in the street to be -
       "auto-anthropology" bad
     - stanley cavell: philosopher's judgements are akin to aesthetics
     - riley bluffed: no philosopher has ever articulated "the
       rules" - just because an expression makes your nose wrinkle,
       that's not a rule - linguists works hard to get at "the
       rules" - hacker is making it up, he can't show "the rules"
     - scientists aren't idiots - they _get it_ 

**** searle: 
     - wittie allows the distinction between pain and pain behavior
       without pain, therefore scientists can just skip the behavior
       and focus on the pain
     - "only a human being and what resembles it can be conscious"
       false because oysters
     - you can't decide what is and is not conscious by analyzing
       language but by empirical science
     - brain is the location of conscious processes; biology can
       account for conscious states; the mistake in thinking otherwise
       is confusing the language for the ontology
     - shut in syndrome: no behavior but conscious states
     - it sounds odd to say "my brain voted for the dems" but not "my
       brain distinguishes between purple and green"
     - "my stomach does not digest, I digest, the whole of me" fine,

*** dark (ßehemoth)
    She remembers a whole different ocean, on the other side of the
    world. Back on Channer Vent you'd turn your lights off and the
    stars would come out, a thousand bioluminescent constellations:
    fish lit up like runways at night; glowing arthropods; little
    grape- sized ctenophores flashing with complex iridescence.
    Channer sang like a siren, lured all those extravagant midwater
    exotics down deeper than they swam anywhere else, fed them strange
    chemicals and turned them monstrously beautiful. Back at Beebe
    Station, /it was only dark when your lights were on/.

*** answer to sissifus	
	Scientists having semi-informal conversations that lean a bit into
	the speculative are always fun, and especially interesting for us,
	but wouldn't want to interrupt this sort of conversation with the
	sort of thing we are likely to say, stuff like "you can't talk
	about non-human concepts, all concepts are human concepts because
	'concept' is a human, English word," because they aren't likely to
	take the right meaning, and then if were to manage to get them to
	get it to my satisfaction, they'll surely be disappointed that I
	wasted their time.

	I think if people got these grammatical observations in the right
	tone, Wittgenstein would be less widely respected, and more
	harshly opposed as a danger to the field, which he deserves. The
	right tone should be one of utter banality, just something no one
	would bat an eye to when told to someone who is indeed learning
	the language.

	I'm not wondering whether the hard problem exists, but how to
	convey that it does not exist best is an open question. I don't
	think "that the world exists is what is mystical" can be much
	improved on, for what good that achieved. Fat luck convincing
	people like Richard Dawkins or John Searle that they've crossed
	over into the mystical.

**** chomsky: 

It is important to understand that the massacre of the rural
population of Vietnam and their forced evacuation is not an accidental
by-product of the war. Rather it is of the very essence of American
strategy. The theory behind it has been explained with great clarity
and explicitness; for example by Professor Samuel Huntington, Chairman
of the Government Department at Harvard and at the time (1968)
Chairman of the Council on Vietnamese Studies of the Southeast Asia
Development Advisory Group, in effect the State Department task force
on Vietnam. Writing in Foreign Affairs, he explains that the Viet Cong
is “a powerful force which cannot be dislodged from its constituency
so long as the constituency continues to exist.” The conclusion is
obvious, and he does not shrink from it. We can ensure that the
constituency ceases to exist by “direct application of mechanical and
conventional power…on such a massive scale as to produce a massive
migration from countryside to city,” where the Viet Cong
constituency—the rural population—can, it is hoped, be controlled in
refugee camps and suburban slums around Saigon.

Technically, the process is known as “urbanization” or
“modernization.” It is described, with the proper contempt, by Daniel
Ellsberg, a Department of Defense consultant on pacification in South
Vietnam, who concludes, from his extensive on-the-spot observations,
that “we have, of course, demolished the society of Vietnam,” that
“the bombing of the South has gone on long enough to disrupt the
society of South Vietnam enormously and probably permanently”; he
speaks of the “people who have been driven to Saigon by what
Huntington regards as our ‘modernizing instruments’ in Vietnam, bombs
and artillery.”4 Reporters have long been aware of the nature of these
tactics, aware that “by now the sheer weight of years of firepower,
massive sweeps, and grand forced population shifts have reduced the
population base of the NLF…”5 so that conceivably, by brute force, we
may still hope to “win.”
**** huntington:

In the space of three brief paragraphs in your January 1 issue, Noam
Chomsky manages to mutilate the truth in a variety of ways with
respect to my views and activities on Vietnam.

...

It would be difficult to conceive of a more blatantly dishonest
instance of picking words out of context so as to give them a meaning
directly opposite to that which the author stated. For the benefit of
your readers, here is the “obvious conclusion” which I drew from my
statement about the Viet Cong:

    …the Viet Cong will remain a powerful force which cannot be
    dislodged from its constituency so long as the constituency
    continues to exist. Peace in the immediate future must hence be
    based on accommodation.

By omitting my next sentence—“Peace in the immediate future must hence
be based on accommodation”—and linking my statement about the Viet
Cong to two other phrases which appear earlier in the article,
Mr. Chomsky completely reversed my argument. (Incidentally, the phrase
“direct application of mechanical and conventional power” is not mine,
but one which I quote from Sir Robert Thompson. Mr. Chomsky, however,
does not see fit to recognize these distinctions of authorship.)
**** chomsky again
stuff... but more sophistic than rest:

Mr. Huntington further claims that I said he “favors” eliminating the
Viet Cong constituency by bombardment, whereas he only states that
such “forced-draft urbanization” may well be “the answer to ‘wars of
national liberation’ ” that we have stumbled upon in Vietnam. The
distinction is rather fine. One who insists on it must also recognize
that I did not say that he “favored” this answer but only that he
“outlined” it, “explained” it, and “does not shrink from it,” all of
which is literally true.

**** styles
plt.style.use("dark_background")
print(plt.style.available)

**** ax.grid(True) doesn't take a zorder
   instead, use ax.set_axisbelow which takes True or False and makes the
   zorder 0.5 or 2.5, so everything else must consider these values if you want the grid
   below or on top

   from notes of ax.grid:
       The axis is drawn as a unit, so the effective zorder for drawing the
    grid is determined by the zorder of each axis, not by the zorder of the
    `.Line2D` objects comprising the grid.  Therefore, to set grid zorder,
    use `.set_axisbelow` or, for more control, call the
    `~.Artist.set_zorder` method of each axis.
**** color maps
cmap = mpl.cm.get_cmap("Spectral")

you can call cmap and get a color value
